Artificial intelligence is transforming the world.

AI systems are now used in healthcare, finance, education, and transportation.
Students who study artificial intelligence learn how machines can think, learn,
and solve problems.

However, artificial intelligence is not magic.
It requires data, algorithms, and careful design.

Learning AI step by step is important.
Practice, curiosity, and persistence matter more than talent.
